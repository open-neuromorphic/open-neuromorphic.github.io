## Getting Started: Local Development Setup

To work on the website locally, you'll need to set up a development environment.

### Prerequisites

*   **Hugo (Extended version):** `0.147.7` or later.
*   **Node.js:** `22.16.0` or later (which includes `npm`).
*   **Go:** `1.24.3` or later.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
    First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account, then clone it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open-neuromorphic.github.io.git
    cd open-neuromorphic.github.io
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` to manage development tools like Tailwind CSS.

    ```bash

### Submitting a Pull Request

All code and content changes should be submitted via a Pull Request (PR).

1.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Use a descriptive name like `feature/new-hardware-page` or `fix/mobile-menu-bug`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2.  **Make Your Changes:** Edit or add files as needed.

3.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages. See our [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-messages).
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat(hardware): Add page for Intel Loihi 2"

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your forked branch to the `main` branch. Provide a clear title and description for your PR. If it resolves an existing issue, link it using `Closes #issue-number`.

## Content Contribution Guide

Adding new content is one of the best ways to contribute. We use Hugo's [archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) to ensure new content has the correct structure. This is especially useful for AI assistants creating content, as the archetypes serve as self-documenting templates.

### Content Creation Cheat Sheet

This table provides the exact commands for creating common content types.

| Content Type | Archetype Command | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blog Post** | `hugo new blog/your-post-slug/index.md` | `content/blog/your-post-slug/` |
| **Workshop** | `hugo new workshops/your-event-slug/index.md` | `content/workshops/your-event-slug/` |
| **Student Talk** | `hugo new neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/your-talk-slug/index.md` | `content/neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/your-talk-slug/` |
| **Hacking Hour** | `hugo new neuromorphic-computing/software/hacking-hours/your-session-slug/index.md` | `content/neuromorphic-computing/software/hacking-hours/your-session-slug/` |
| **Hardware Page** | `hugo new neuromorphic-computing/hardware/manufacturer-chip/index.md` | `content/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/manufacturer-chip/` |
| **Software Page** | `hugo new neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/software-name/index.md` | `content/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/software-name/` |
| **Contributor** | `hugo new contributors/full-name-slug/index.md` | `content/contributors/full-name-slug/` |
| **Initiative** | `hugo new neuromorphic-computing/initiatives/your-initiative-slug/index.md`| `content/neuromorphic-computing/initiatives/your-initiative-slug/` |

### General Guidelines

*   **Use Archetypes:** Always create new content with `hugo new <path>` if possible. If you are creating a file manually, copy the relevant file from the `archetypes/` directory to use as a template.
*   **Draft Status:** New content is created with `draft: true`. This prevents it from being published. When your content is ready, change this to `draft: false`.
*   **SEO is Key:**
    *   **`title`:** 50-60 characters. Make it descriptive and keyword-rich.
    *   **`description`:** 120-160 characters. This is the summary shown in search engine results.

### Adding Blog Posts

1.  **Create the file:** (template: [archetypes/blog.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/blog.md))
    ```bash
    hugo new blog/your-post-title-slug/index.md
    ```
2.  **Location:** `content/blog/your-post-title-slug/index.md`
3.  **Front Matter:** Fill in the `title`, `description`, `author`, and `image` (for the banner). Remember to add `image_attribution` if the banner image requires credit.
4.  **Images:** Place images for the post inside the `content/blog/your-post-title-slug/` directory.

### Adding Events

Events like workshops, student talks, and hacking hours share a similar structure.

1.  **Create the file:** Use the appropriate command from the cheat sheet.
    *   Workshop (template: [archetypes/workshops.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/workshops.md))
    *   Student Talk (template: [archetypes/student-talks.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/student-talks.md))
    *   Hacking Hour (template: [archetypes/hacking-hours.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/hacking-hours.md))
2.  **Front Matter:** Fill in all event-specific fields: `title`, `author`, `date` (event date), `start_time`, `end_time`, `time_zone`, `upcoming`, `video` (add YouTube ID after the event), `image`, `speaker_photo`, and `speaker_bio`.

### Adding Hardware or Software Pages

1.  **Create the file:** Use the appropriate command from the cheat sheet.
    *   Hardware (template: [archetypes/neuromorphic-hardware.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/neuromorphic-hardware.md))
    *   Software (template: [archetypes/neuromorphic-software.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/neuromorphic-software.md))
2.  **Front Matter:** Follow the structure in the respective archetype. These pages have detailed front matter for specifications.
3.  **Images:** Place logos and product images inside the new directory.

### Adding Contributor Profiles

To link content to an author, a contributor profile is required.

1.  **Create the file:** (template: [archetypes/contributors.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/archetypes/contributors.md))
    ```bash
    hugo new contributors/full-name-slug/index.md
    ```
    The slug should be the person's name, lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `jens-e-pedersen`).
2.  **Front Matter:**
    *   The **`title`** field **must be the person's full name**. This exact string is used to link them from the `author` field in other content.
    *   Add a profile `image` (square) and `social` links.

## Image Guidelines

*   **Placement:** For content-specific images (banners, figures, speaker photos), place them inside the page bundle directory (e.g., `content/blog/my-post/`).
*   **Global Images:** For general site images, use the `static/images/` directory.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Banners / Open Graph (OG) Images:** 1200x630px.
    *   **Profile / Speaker Photos:** Square (e.g., 200x200px).
*   **OG Images:** The site automatically generates Open Graph images for social sharing based on the page's `title` and `description`. Providing a high-quality `image` in the front matter (1200x630px) will override the generated one for that page.

## Style and Coding Guidelines

*   **Templates:** Hugo templates are located in `layouts/`.
*   **Styling:** We use Tailwind CSS. Custom styles are in `assets/scss/`.
*   **JavaScript:** Custom scripts are in `assets/js/main.js`.

### Commit Messages

Please follow a conventional commit format to keep the history clean and understandable.

*   `feat`: A new feature (e.g., `feat(search): Add live search functionality`).
*   `fix`: A bug fix (e.g., `fix(css): Correct mobile menu alignment`).
*   `docs`: Documentation-only changes (e.g., `docs: Update contribution guide`).
*   `style`: Code style changes (e.g., `style: Format SCSS files`).
*   `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
*   `content`: For adding or updating content (e.g., `content(blog): Add post on hardware trends`).
*   `chore`: Build process or tooling changes (e.g., `chore: Upgrade Tailwind CSS to v3.4`).
