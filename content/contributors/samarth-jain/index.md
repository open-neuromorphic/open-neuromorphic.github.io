Samarth Jain is the Co-Founder and Director at BM LABS, a company that originated from his student research project. His work, inspired by his publication in Nature Communications, focuses on developing neuromorphic IPs for in-memory compute that are compatible with open PDKs and open-source tools. BM LABS is also working on open-source compilers to deploy AI models on chips, with the goal of enabling students and the community to build upon their IP.
