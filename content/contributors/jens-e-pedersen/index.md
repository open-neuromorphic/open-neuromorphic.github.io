Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/profile/jeped/) working to model and construct [neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) systems.

When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms fail spectacularly. There is a strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems to help solve our everyday physical problems.

By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom ''What I cannot create, I do not understand''.

He is the maintainer of [norse](/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/norse/) and [AEStream](/neuromorphic-computing/software/data-tools/aestream/).
