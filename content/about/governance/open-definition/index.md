To be considered a fully open resource in our community, a work **MUST**:

-   Allow anyone to study, modify, and share the material for any purpose, including commercial use.
-   Provide materials in a publicly accessible format that allows for modification and reuse. For text or code, this means source files (e.g., Markdown, notebooks). For other media, the published format is often the source (e.g., a CC-licensed PDF or YouTube video).
-   Not restrict derivatives.
-   Not be released under a "Non-Commercial" (NC) license.

A resource **MAY**:

-   Require attribution be given to the original creators (like CC-BY).
-   Require derivatives to carry a reciprocal license (like Share-Alike "SA" or GPL).

We will prioritize resources with permissive licenses like CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, MIT, and Apache 2.0. While we still value resources with Non-Commercial (NC) or No-Derivatives (ND) clauses, we will mark them as having restrictions, as they do not grant the full freedom to the community to build upon them.
