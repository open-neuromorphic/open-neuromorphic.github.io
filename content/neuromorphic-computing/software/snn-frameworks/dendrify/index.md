## Overview
**Dendrify** is an open-source Python package designed to work seamlessly with the Brian 2 simulator. Dendrify enables users to generate reduced compartmental neuron models with biologically relevant dendritic and synaptic properties using simple commands. These models strike a good balance between flexibility, performance, and accuracy, making it possible to study the impact of dendrites on network-level functions.
