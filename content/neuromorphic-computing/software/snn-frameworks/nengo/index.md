## Overview
**Nengo**, also known as "Brain Maker", is a versatile open-source Python package designed for building, testing, and applying neural networks, and it supports many backends for  spiking neural networks (SNNs). Developed and maintained by Trevor Bekolov, Nengo is accompanied by comprehensive and extensive documentation that covers all of its plugins and example implementations of Nengo plugins for newcomers. The framework boasts a large and passionate community that supports and contributes to Nengo.

Nengo is unique for its seamless compatability with many different applications FPGA boards, Intel's Loihi chip, TensorFlow, an HTML-5 interactive visualizer, and PyTorch to name a few. The project supports a wide range of neuron types and is highly adaptable, allowing users to deploy various cognitive and perceptual models on both conventional and neuromorphic hardware. With its wide variety of applications, Nengo provides a user-friendly syntax and high-level abstractions, making it accessible for both researchers and newcomers to deep learning and neural networks.
