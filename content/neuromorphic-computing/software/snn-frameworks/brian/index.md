## Overview
**Brian2** is an open-source Python library for the simulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs), notable for its user-friendly syntax and flexible approach to the design and simulation of neural models. Brian2 has been continually maintained by Romain Brette, Marcel Stimberg, and Dan Goodman since 2012. They heavily encourage and support community contributions and involvement. Having been publicly available for 12 years, Brian2 positions itself as the pillar of the neuromorphic community.

It was one of the first to provide a user-friendly and flexible library for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding and advancing the field of SNNs. Brian2 has a robust community, comprehensive documentation, and stays competitive with the latest advancements in neural network simulations, making it a powerful tool in both teaching and research.

The framework emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and extensibility, making it a popular choice for both teaching and research. The neural models in Brian2 are defined using equations directly, streamlining the transition from theoretical models to simulation code. This feature significantly lowers the barriers to entry for those who are new to computational modeling.

With neuron models defined by equations and the ability to specify synaptic connections, the network's topology and construction have a very low level of abstraction. This design allows users to have creative freedom in designing their networks and serves as an effective way to learn the principles of both spiking and non-spiking neural networks.
