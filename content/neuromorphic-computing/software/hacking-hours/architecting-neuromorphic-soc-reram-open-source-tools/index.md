Join us for a special Hacking Hour with Samarth Jain, Co-Founder of BM LABS, for a technical deep-dive into designing neuromorphic hardware with open-source tools. This session provides a practical guide to architecting a System-on-Chip (SoC) and introduces the **NVM Power-Up Design Contest**â€”a unique opportunity to get your design fabricated for free.

### What You'll Learn:

*   **From Research to Product:** Hear about Samarth's journey from a student research project and a Nature Communications paper to founding BM LABS.
*   **Open-Source ASIC Tools:** Get an overview of the open-source ecosystem, including Caravel, OpenLane2/LibreLane, and their role in neuromorphic hardware development.
*   **Hands-On Demonstration:** Learn how to architect a working SoC that strategically uses ReRAM NVM IP on the SkyWater SKY130 process.
*   **The NVM Power-Up Contest:** Discover the contest timeline, project goals, and how you can apply the skills from this talk to compete for a free fabrication spot on the November shuttle.

This event is perfect for students and researchers who aspire to turn their academic work into real-world hardware and for anyone interested in the practical side of neuromorphic chip design.
