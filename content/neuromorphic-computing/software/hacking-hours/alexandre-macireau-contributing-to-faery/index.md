Have you ever had a problem with event cameras that you had no idea how to approach? You're not alone and we're gathering a community of people to help each other out in Faery.
Every time we fix an issue, researchers like you will benefit from it. And, since this is open-source and freely available, we fix it for all perpetuity!

In this session, Alexandre Marcireau, who has been working with open-source event camera software for years, will guide us through the process of contributing to Faery.
We will pick an issue that we want to solve, and start from scratch to show you how contributions are usually made: by setting up your environment, forking the repository, making our changes, and, finally, submitting a pull request.

This session is for anyone interested in contributing to Faery, whether you're a seasoned developer or new to open-source contributions. No prior experience with Faery is necessary, but a basic understanding of programming and version control (e.g., Git) will be helpful.
