Hacking Hours are live, interactive coding sessions dedicated to exploring the world of neuromorphic software. Hosted by Jens Pedersen, these sessions often feature guest developers from the community and industry to provide deep dives into specific neuromorphic frameworks, tools, and problem-solving techniques.

These sessions are more focused than our general community calls, aiming to produce curated videos and tangible progress on open-source projects. You can still interact with guests and ask questions via the live chat on the stream.

### Community Coding Initiative

A core goal of Hacking Hours is to improve the neuromorphic software ecosystem. Below is a preview of open-source projects that are actively looking for contributors. This is a great way to get involved and make a real impact on the tools we all use.
