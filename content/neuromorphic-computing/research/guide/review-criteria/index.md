This document details the official review criteria for the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) program. It is to be used by both submitters preparing their work and reviewers evaluating submissions.

## Core Principles

Reviewers are expected to adhere to the following principles, inspired by the broader open science movement:

1.  **I will sign my name to my review.** (Transparency)
2.  **I will review with integrity.** (Objectivity)
3.  **I will treat the review as a discourse... and provide constructive criticism.** (Constructiveness)
4.  **I will be an ambassador for the practice of open science.** (Advocacy)

## Evaluation Rubric

| Category | Criteria | Reviewer Questions |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Relevance** | Submission is within the scope of neuromorphic computing (hardware, software, methods, applications). | Does this fit the ONR mission? |
| **2. Clarity** | Well-organized, readable, and logically structured. | Is the purpose clear? Are visuals and code well-explained? |
| **3. Reproducibility** | Methods, code, and data are clearly documented for replication. | Could another researcher replicate the results with the materials provided? |
| **4. Technical Rigor** | The approach is technically sound and well-supported. | Does the submission reflect good scientific/engineering practices? |
| **5. Contribution** | Demonstrates a non-trivial or novel contribution (tool, method, experiment, or insight). | Is the contribution clearly articulated and meaningful? |
| **6. Openness** | Uses permissive licensing (e.g., MIT, Apache, CC-BY) and open tools/formats. | Are all components accessible and reusable under our [Definition of Open](/about/governance/open-definition/)? |
| **7. Compliance** | Adheres to ONR submission guidelines. | Are the format, structure, and metadata correct? |
| **8. Community Value** | Has potential to be reused, extended, or learned from by the ONM community. | Would this benefit students, researchers, or developers? |

## Reviewer Recommendation

-   **Accept:** The submission meets the criteria and is ready for the "ONM Community Approved" badge.
-   **Recommend Modifications:** The submission is promising but requires specific, actionable changes before it can be accepted.

## Reviewer Comments

Please provide brief, constructive feedback addressing:
-   **Strengths** of the submission.
-   **Suggestions** for improvement.
-   **Specific concerns** related to clarity, rigor, or reproducibility.
