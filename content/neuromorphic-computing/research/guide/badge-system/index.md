## The "ONM Community Approved" Badge

The "ONM Community Approved" badge is a mark of quality and trust within the neuromorphic ecosystem. It signifies that a project, paper, or resource has successfully passed the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) community peer-review process.

Earning the badge means your project will be featured in our [Approved Research Registry](/neuromorphic-computing/research/papers/), with a dedicated page that serves as a permanent certificate of its approval.

### What the Badge Represents

When you see this badge, it means the work has been evaluated against our [official review criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria/) and has been recognized for its:

-   **Clarity:** The work is well-documented and easy to understand.
-   **Reproducibility:** The results can be independently verified by the community.
-   **Impact:** The contribution is valuable and relevant to the neuromorphic field.
-   **Openness:** The work adheres to open-source principles with permissive licensing.

## The Certificate Page

Each project that successfully passes the ONR review is granted a permanent "certificate" page within our [Approved Research Registry](/neuromorphic-computing/research/papers/). This page serves as the official record of the community's endorsement and typically includes:

-   An overview of the project and its contributions.
-   Direct links to the resource (e.g., GitHub repository, paper).
-   A link to the public peer-review discussion on OpenReview.
-   The date of community approval.

The badge that you display on your project will link directly to this certificate page.

## How to Display the Badge

Once your submission is approved and your certificate page is live, you are encouraged to display the badge prominently in your project's `README.md` file on GitHub or on your project's website.

The badge should link to your specific certificate page on `open-neuromorphic.org`.
