Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Initiative! This guide outlines how to submit your work for review and inclusion in our Community Peer Review Program. Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis.

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome open-source neuromorphic projects of all kinds, including but not limited to:

-   Research codebases (e.g., SNN models, simulators, benchmarks)
-   Datasets and dataset preparation pipelines
-   Educational tools, tutorials, and documentation
-   Hardware support libraries and FPGA/ASIC interfaces
-   Analysis tools, visualization, and measurement utilities

Submissions may take the form of:
-   **Git repositories** containing software and documentation
-   **Jupyter notebooks** with code, figures, and narrative explanations
-   **IEEE-formatted papers** (PDF)
-   **Technical whitepapers** or overview documents (PDF or web-hosted)

Your project must satisfy Open Neuromorphic's [Definition of Open](/about/governance/open-definition/).

We especially encourage well-documented Jupyter notebooks that walk through core functionality, demonstrate reproducibility, or explain concepts interactively. Also, please try to submit source files of figures if possible.

## How to Submit

### Prerequisites

**All authors must have existing OpenReview profiles** before submitting. If you don't have one:
1.  Create an account at [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/)
2.  Complete your profile with your name, email, and affiliations
3.  Ensure your profile ID follows the format `~FirstName_LastName#` (e.g., `~Jane_Doe1`)

### Submission Process

Submit your work through OpenReview using the official ONR submission form.
ðŸ”— **[OpenReview ONR Submission Portal](https://openreview.net/)**

You will be required to provide the following information:

#### Submission Details

1.  **Title** *(required)*
  -   Max length: 250 characters
  -   Supports TeX formulas (e.g., `$â€¦$` for inline, `$$â€¦$$` for display math)

2.  **Abstract** *(required)*
  -   Max length: 5000 characters
  -   Clearly summarize your contribution, methods, and findings

3.  **Authors** *(required)*
  -   Comma-separated list (e.g., `Jane Doe, John Smith`)

4.  **Author IDs** *(required)*
  -   Comma-separated OpenReview profile IDs (e.g., `~Jane_Doe1`)

5.  **PDF** *(required)*
  -   Upload a `.pdf` file (max size: 50 MB)
  -   Include title, authors, abstract, and references

6.  **Submission Length** *(required)*
  -   Choose: `Regular submission (â‰¤8 pages)` or `Long submission (>8 pages)`

7.  **Supplementary Material** *(optional)*
  -   Upload `.zip` or `.pdf` (max size: 100 MB)
  -   May include code, datasets, figures, or videos

8.  **Previous Submission URL** *(optional)*
  -   Provide the OpenReview URL if revising a prior submission

9.  **Changes Since Last Submission** *(optional)*
  -   Describe updates made since the previous submission

10. **Competing Interests** *(required)*
  -   Disclose conflicts of interest or enter `N/A`

11. **Human Subjects Reporting** *(required)*
  -   Provide details if applicable, or enter `N/A`

### After Submission

Your submission will be reviewed by a panel of 3â€“5 ONM volunteer reviewers. You'll receive confirmation and an estimated timeline for decisions.

> Note: Submissions that do not meet the basic requirements (e.g., scope, clarity, or compliance with the Definition of Open) may be desk rejected without further review.
## Review Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on our official [Review Criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria/), which prioritizes openness, impact, clarity, and reproducibility.

## Outcomes

We expect to provide decisions within one month of submission.

-   **If approved**, your project will receive an "ONM Community Approved" badge and will be featured in the ONR program registry.
-   **If not yet approved**, youâ€™ll receive actionable feedback and may revise and resubmit.
