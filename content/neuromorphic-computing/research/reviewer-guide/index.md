This document serves as a reference for reviewers when considering submissions to the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) program.

## 1. Workflow on OpenReview

1.  **Profile Setup:** Please update your OpenReview profile to ensure your expertise is accurately reflected for assignment matching.
2.  **Assignment:** You will be notified of assigned papers via your OpenReview "Reviewer Console." If you have a conflict of interest or lack the required expertise, please notify your Area Chair immediately.
3.  **Submission:** Submit your review using the structured form within OpenReview. You can save drafts and edit your review up until the deadline.

## 2. Guidelines for Constructive Feedback

1.  **Summary:** Begin with a concise summary of the submission’s goals and contributions.
2.  **Strengths:** Highlight positive aspects such as clarity, novelty, and open-science contributions.
3.  **Major Issues:** Focus on elements impacting reproducibility, methodology, or clarity.
4.  **Actionable Suggestions:** Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement (e.g., "Provide parameter settings used in simulations," or "Deposit code in a version-controlled repository with a DOI.").
5.  **Tone:** Maintain a respectful and constructive tone throughout.
6.  **Recommendation:** Conclude with a clear recommendation (Accept or Recommend Modifications).

## 3. Review Criteria

Reviewers should be guided by our four core principles:
1.  **Sign your name** to your review.
2.  Review with **integrity**.
3.  Provide **constructive criticism**.
4.  Be an **ambassador for open science**.

All submissions are evaluated against the official [ONR Review Criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/review-criteria/). Please familiarize yourself with this rubric before beginning your review.
