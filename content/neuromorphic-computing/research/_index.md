Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) hub. This initiative is designed to foster open, reproducible, and high-quality research within the neuromorphic community through a transparent peer-review process.

Our goal is to create a trusted registry of community-vetted projects, papers, and tools that exemplify the best practices of open science. By establishing a clear set of standards and a transparent review process, we aim to:
- **Increase Trust:** Provide a clear signal of quality for community-vetted projects.
- **Promote Reproducibility:** Encourage best practices in documenting and sharing research.
- **Accelerate Innovation:** Make it easier for researchers to build upon each other's work.
