The **Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program** is now accepting submissions on a rolling basis! We invite researchers, developers, and educators in the neuromorphic computing field to submit their open-source projects for community peer review and recognition.

## What is the ONR Program?

The ONR Program is a community-driven peer review initiative designed to validate and highlight reproducible, high-impact research in neuromorphic computing. Through a transparent review process managed on OpenReview, we aim to create a trusted registry of community-vetted projects that exemplify best practices in open science.

For complete details about the program, see [Pull Request #360](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/pull/360) which contains comprehensive documentation about submission guidelines, review criteria, and the badge system.

## Why Submit Your Work?

By participating in the ONR Program, you can:

- **Gain Visibility:** Get your work recognized and highlighted by the neuromorphic community
- **Build Trust:** Earn the "ONM Community Approved" badge for your project
- **Accelerate Science:** Contribute to a shared ecosystem of reliable and reusable research
- **Get Constructive Feedback:** Receive expert review from community volunteers
- **Showcase Excellence:** Featured projects receive a dedicated certificate page in our Approved Research Registry

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome open-source neuromorphic projects of all kinds, including:

- Research codebases (e.g., SNN models, simulators, benchmarks)
- Datasets and dataset preparation pipelines
- Educational tools, tutorials, and documentation
- Hardware support libraries and FPGA/ASIC interfaces
- Analysis tools, visualization, and measurement utilities

Submissions may take the form of Git repositories, Jupyter notebooks, IEEE-formatted papers, or technical whitepapers. All projects must satisfy Open Neuromorphic's [Definition of Open](/about/governance/open-definition/).

## How to Submit

The submission process is straightforward:

1. **Prepare Your Submission:** Review the detailed submission guidelines in [PR #360](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/pull/360) for requirements and formatting
2. **Create OpenReview Profiles:** Ensure all authors have OpenReview accounts at [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/)
3. **Submit via OpenReview:** Use the official ONR submission portal to upload your work
4. **Community Review:** Your submission will be evaluated by 3-5 volunteer reviewers based on established review criteria
5. **Receive Recognition:** Approved projects receive the ONM Community Approved badge and a certificate page

## Review Criteria

All submissions are evaluated based on:

- **Relevance:** Fits within the scope of neuromorphic computing
- **Clarity:** Well-organized, readable, and logically structured
- **Reproducibility:** Methods, code, and data clearly documented for replication
- **Technical Rigor:** Scientifically and technically sound approach
- **Contribution:** Demonstrates meaningful contribution to the field
- **Openness:** Uses permissive licensing and open tools
- **Community Value:** Has potential to benefit students, researchers, or developers

Complete review criteria and evaluation rubric are available in [PR #360](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/pull/360).

## Timeline

- **Submissions:** Accepted on a rolling basis
- **Review Process:** Approximately 1 month from submission
- **Decisions:** Clear feedback provided for all submissions

## About the Program

The ONR Program was launched to address the need for transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in neuromorphic computing research. By establishing a clear set of standards and a transparent peer-review process, we aim to:

- **Increase Trust:** Provide a clear signal of quality for community-vetted projects
- **Promote Reproducibility:** Encourage best practices in documenting and sharing research
- **Accelerate Innovation:** Make it easier for researchers to build upon each other's work

The program includes a badge system where approved projects can display the "ONM Community Approved" badge, linking to a permanent certificate page that serves as the official record of community endorsement.
