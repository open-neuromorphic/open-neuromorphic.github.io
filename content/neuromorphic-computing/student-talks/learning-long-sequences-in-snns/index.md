Matei’s published work, “Learning Long Sequences in Spiking Neural Networks” [1], systematically investigates, for the first time, the intersection of the State‑of‑The‑Art State Space Models (SSMs) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for long‑range sequence modelling. Results suggest that SSM‑based SNNs can outperform the Transformer on all tasks of a well‑established long‑range sequence modelling benchmark - the “Long-Range Arena” [2]. It is also shown that the SSM‑based SNNs can outperform current State‑of‑The‑Art SNNs with fewer parameters on sequential image classification. Finally, a novel feature mixing layer is introduced, improving SNN accuracy while challenging assumptions about the role of binary activations in SNNs. This work paves the way for deploying powerful SSM-based architectures, such as Large Language Models, on neuromorphic hardware for energy-efficient long-range sequence modelling.

This talk will highlight, at a high level, the similarities in computational primitives between SSMs and the existing neuromorphic standards such as Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. It will also focus on the specific drawbacks brought about by the introduction of binary activations in SSMs, as well as the extent to which these can be mitigated by the development of more accurate surrogate gradient methods that account for non-differentiability. Finally, arguments will be presented in favour of separating biological plausibility from energy efficiency in attempting to create scalable neuromorphic solutions.
