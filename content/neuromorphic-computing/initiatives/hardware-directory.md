This initiative focuses on the creation and curation of comprehensive guides to neuromorphic hardware and software. The goal is to build central, open-source repositories of information, making it easier for researchers and developers to compare systems, find relevant resources, and navigate the ecosystem.

The outcomes of this effort include:
*   The **[Neuromorphic Hardware Guide](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/)**
*   The **[Neuromorphic Software Guide](/neuromorphic-computing/software/)**
