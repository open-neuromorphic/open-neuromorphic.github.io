summary: "SENeCA is a RISC-V-based digital neuromorphic processor targeting extreme edge applications by accelerating Spiking Neural Networks inside or near sensors and small devices where ultra-low power and adaptivity are required. It inherits fundamental properties from the biological brain: spatio-temporal sparsity exploitation, parallel processing, infinite scalability, low-precision parameters, asynchronous non-deterministic execution, adaptation and fault-tolerance architecture, interconnect of neuron cluster cores with RISC-V-based instruction set."

## Overview
SENeCA is a RISC-V-based digital neuromorphic processor targeting extreme edge applications by accelerating Spiking Neural Networks inside or near sensors and small devices where ultra-low power and adaptivity are required. It inherits fundamental properties from the biological brain: spatio-temporal sparsity exploitation, parallel processing, infinite scalability, low-precision parameters, asynchronous non-deterministic execution, adaptation and fault-tolerance architecture, interconnect of neuron cluster cores with RISC-V-based instruction set. SENeCA has fully programmable neuron models and learning/adaptivity algorithms. It is accessible for academic research.
