glossary:
- term: Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
  definition: A type of artificial neural network that closely models the spiking behavior of biological neurons, utilizing discrete spikes or pulses of activity for information processing.
- term: Event-Driven Computation
  definition: A computing paradigm where processing occurs in response to specific events or stimuli, allowing for energy-efficient operation and asynchronous communication between components.
- term: Synapse
  definition: The functional connection between two neurons or between a neuron and another cell, where signals are transmitted through chemical or electrical means.
- term: Plasticity
  definition: The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, a key feature in neuromorphic hardware that enables learning and adaptation.
- term: Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
  definition: A type of synaptic plasticity in which the timing of neural spikes influences the strength of the synapse, essential for learning and memory in neuromorphic systems.
- term: Memristor
  definition: A resistor with memory, a key component in neuromorphic hardware that can store and process information, mimicking the synaptic plasticity found in biological systems.
- term: Neuromorphic Chip
  definition: A specialized hardware component designed to implement neuromorphic computing principles, often featuring a large number of simple, interconnected processing units.
- term: Neuromorphic Engineering
  definition: The interdisciplinary field that combines principles from neuroscience, physics, computer science, and engineering to design and build brain-inspired computing systems.
- term: Event-Based Sensor
  definition: A sensor that captures and transmits information in an event-driven manner, aligning with the principles of neuromorphic hardware for efficient and low-latency data processing.
- term: SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture)
  definition: A neuromorphic computing platform designed for simulating large-scale spiking neural networks, with a focus on real-time processing and parallel communication.
