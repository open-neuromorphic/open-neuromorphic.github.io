Neuromorphic engineering takes inspiration from biological systems to process information as efficiently as possible. Such systems can be the mammal brain that burns just 20W, a retina that compresses visual information or the navigation system of a bee. We then try to mimic those systems to a certain level of abstraction on another substrate such as silicon. But the von Neumann architecture, which our computers are based on, doesn't work like biological systems! It separates memory from computation and not noisy at all! This brings us to the first important principle of neuromorphic engineering, which is that it relies on new hardware architectures!

## Summary
Neuromorphic is not going to replace conventional computing completely. Rather, it will be another strand in an increasingly heterogeneous computing landscape.Neuromorphic tech is going to unlock extra capabilities of edge computation for always-on monitoring, speech recognition and large-scale data integration. It won't compete with high-throughput tasks such as image classification.
Why are not all neuromorphic chips mixed-signal today? Until we figure out how to train large networks reliably that can cope with high variance of the underlying hardware, we rely on the long history of CMOS progress and the determinism of digital architectures that act as stabilizing wheels on our neuromorphic bicycle. The highest gains in energy-efficiency will be achieved with the use of analog computing, but until then, some issues still have to be figured out.
