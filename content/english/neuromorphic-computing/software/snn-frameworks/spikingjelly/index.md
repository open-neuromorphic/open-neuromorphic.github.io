## Overview
SpikingJelly is an open-source deep learning framework designed for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on PyTorch. Which allows it to leverage PyTorch's user-friendly interface and robust computational capabilities, including GPU acceleration. This integration makes SpikingJelly an accessible and powerful tool for both researchers and practitioners in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

It aims to bring brain-inspired intelligence to neuromorphic chips with high energy efficiency by incorporating neural dynamics and spike properties. SpikingJelly addresses the need for automatic differentiation, parallel computation acceleration, and integration of neuromorphic datasets in the spiking deep learning paradigm. The framework provides a full-stack toolkit for preprocessing neuromorphic datasets, constructing deep SNNs, optimizing parameters, and deploying on neuromorphic chips.

Developed by the Multimedia Learning Group, Institute of Digital Media (NELVT) at Peking University, and Peng Cheng Laboratory, SpikingJelly is contributing to the evolution of energy-efficient, spike-based machine intelligence systems. Overall, SpikingJelly is a valuable tool for advancing SNN research, offering a blend of accessibility and powerful computational tools for exploring the dynamic world of spiking neural networks.
