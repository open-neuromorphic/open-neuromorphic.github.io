## Overview
Norse is a deep learning library for spiking neural networks that expands PyTorch with bio-inspired neural components. It leverages the sparse and event-driven nature of biological neural networks, significantly different from artificial neural networks, to deliver a modern, efficient computational model. Norse provides an array of primitives for spiking systems, and is designed to be highly adaptable, allowing for custom model creation and integration with existing deep learning models.

The documentation suggests ways to get started with Norse, including running pre-included tasks like MNIST classification, CIFAR classification, and cartpole balancing with policy gradient, showcasing its compatibility with PyTorch Lightning. Norse aims to be a foundational tool for translating traditional deep learning models to the spiking domain, supporting new model development, or enhancing existing models with spiking network capabilities. It acknowledges the resource-intensive nature of spiking neural networks and provides guidance on hardware acceleration to optimize simulation performance.

Norse is a community-driven project, inviting contributions and maintaining high code quality standards. It is the creation of Christian Pehle, a PostDoc at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, and Jens E. Pedersen, a doctoral student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, with funding support from various European and German research initiatives. The library is licensed under LGPLv3, ensuring open access and contribution to the broader scientific community.
