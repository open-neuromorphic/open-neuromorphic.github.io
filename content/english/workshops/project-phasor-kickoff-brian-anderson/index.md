Project Phasor aims to prioritize the neuromorphic and NeuroAI issues best solved together. Anchoring the proposed efforts will be a set of neuromorphic virtual machines and a shared production-quality compiler. Development will be within an open governance body. Special focus will be on datacenter-scale training, solving heterogeneous integration, and making architecture search easy.

We are also exploring the creation of a joint research fund for NeuroAI and neuromorphic research using the quantum-focused Unitary Foundation as inspiration.

Join us to learn the big takeaways from of our intense week of kickoff meetings earlier in the month.

We will allocate a lot of time for discussion, so folks can help steer the efforts and also help us strategize ways to precipitate something great.
