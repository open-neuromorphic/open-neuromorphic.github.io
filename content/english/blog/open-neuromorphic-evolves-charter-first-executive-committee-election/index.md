Exciting news from the Open Neuromorphic (ONM) community! As our community continues to grow and thrive, we're taking an important step towards a more structured and sustainable future. Today, we're announcing the introduction of an **ONM Organisational Charter** and the upcoming election of our very first **Executive Committee**.

## Why the Change?

ONM has always been about open collaboration and shared passion for neuromorphic computing. To ensure we can continue supporting our community effectively and manage our activities transparently, we believe a light organizational structure is needed. This charter and elected committee aim to provide clarity, coordinate efforts, and empower members to contribute even more meaningfully.

## Introducing the ONM Charter

We've drafted an Organisational Charter that outlines the purpose, governance structure, and decision-making processes for ONM. Key highlights include:

*   **Purpose:** Formalizing our mission to facilitate idea exchange, support collaboration, and build an inclusive community.
*   **Governance:** Establishing a Core Leadership Team (Executive Committee).
*   **Working Groups (WGs):** Empowering community-driven groups for specific activities (events, hackathons, outreach).
*   **Decision-Making:** Defining processes for routine and strategic decisions.
*   **Annual General Meeting (AGM):** Creating a yearly forum for review, goal-setting, and elections.

**We invite *you* to review the draft charter and share your thoughts!** Your feedback is crucial to shaping the future of ONM.

## Electing the First Executive Committee

Alongside the charter, we will be electing our inaugural Executive Committee, consisting of three key roles:

1.  **Chair:** Holds overall responsibility for coordinating ONM activities, external representation, and setting the AGM agenda.
2.  **Vice-Chair:** Supports the Chair in strategic planning and operational decisions, acting on behalf of the Chair when needed.
3.  **Secretary:** Responsible for maintaining records, documenting meetings, and ensuring administrative transparency.

**Who can run?** Anyone who is an active member of the wider neuromorphic community is welcome to put themselves forward.

**How to nominate:** If you're interested in running for one of these positions, please add your name to the nominations spreadsheet:
