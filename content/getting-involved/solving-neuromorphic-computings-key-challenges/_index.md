Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Mission Board! The progress of neuromorphic computing is propelled by a vibrant open-source community, but it also faces key challenges in software, interoperability, and tooling. This board is a community-curated list of high-impact challenges where your contributions can make a real difference.

By tackling these issues, you can help support vital open-source tools, prevent maintainer burnout, and directly contribute to the future of the field.

{{< details summary="Project Maintainers: Add Your Project's Tasks" >}}
Are you a maintainer in the neuromorphic ecosystem? We invite you to connect with us to feature your project's tasks and guide community contributions. Here’s how you can get involved:

#### Step 1: Tag Your GitHub Issues
Our automated system uses a priority-based approach to select issues for this board.

-   **Primary Method (Recommended):** Add the `onm-collab` label to issues you'd like to feature. The system will prioritize the three most recent open issues with this tag. This is the best way to signal that a task is aligned with our community's collaborative goals.

-   **Fallback Method:** If a project has no open issues tagged with `onm-collab`, the system will automatically select the three most recent open issues, regardless of their labels.

While not required for selection, we still recommend using tags like `good first issue`, `documentation`, `bug`, `enhancement`, and `testing` to help contributors find tasks that match their skills.

#### Step 2: Add Persistent Links (Optional)
If you have important links like a **sponsorship page**, an **onboarding guide**, or other resources you'd like to feature permanently on your project's card, please reach out to us.

-   **Contact Us:** Message an **Executive Committee member** on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aPFsSRA7Nf) or email us at [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org).
-   **Provide Links:** Let us know the title and URL for each link you want to add. We will add them to the `data/community_projects.toml` file for you.

This ensures your project not only gets help with specific tasks but also directs community members to your key resources.
