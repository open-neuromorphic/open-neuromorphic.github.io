Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Mission Board! The progress of neuromorphic computing is propelled by a vibrant open-source community, but it also faces key challenges in software, interoperability, and tooling. This board is a community-curated list of high-impact challenges where your contributions can make a real difference.

By tackling these issues, you can help support vital open-source tools, prevent maintainer burnout, and directly contribute to the future of the field.

{{< details summary="Project Maintainers: Add Your Project's Tasks" >}}
Are you a maintainer in the neuromorphic ecosystem? We invite you to connect with us to feature your project's tasks and guide community contributions. This board is automatically updated daily to reflect the latest open issues from participating projects. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

#### Step 1: Tag Your GitHub Issues
Our automated system uses a priority-based approach to select issues for this board.

-   **Primary Method (Recommended):** Add the `help wanted` label to issues you'd like to feature. The system will prioritize the three most recent open issues with this tag. This is the best way to signal that a task is aligned with our community's collaborative goals.

-   **Fallback Method:** If a project has no open issues tagged with `help wanted`, the system will automatically select the three most recent open issues, regardless of their labels.

While not required for selection, we still recommend using tags like `good first issue`, `documentation`, `bug`, `enhancement`, and `testing` to help contributors find tasks that match their skills.

#### Step 2: Add Persistent Links (Optional)
If you have important links like a **sponsorship page**, an **onboarding guide**, or other resources you'd like to feature permanently on your project's card, please reach out to us.

-   **Contact Us:** Message an **Executive Committee member** on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aPFsSRA7Nf) or email us at [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org).
-   **Provide Links:** Let us know the title and URL for each link you want to add. We will add them to the `data/community_projects.toml` file for you.

This ensures your project not only gets help with specific tasks but also directs community members to your key resources.
