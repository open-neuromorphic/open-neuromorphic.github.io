Sharing your knowledge with the community is one of the most impactful ways to contribute. We are always looking for passionate individuals to present their work, lead a tutorial, or spark a discussion. You don't need to be a seasoned presenter—our team is here to handle the hosting logistics and support you every step of the way.

## Submit to the Open Neuromorphic Research Program

Looking to get your research recognized and reviewed by the community? Consider submitting your work to our **Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program**—a community-driven peer review initiative that validates and highlights reproducible, high-impact research.

### What is the ONR Program?

The ONR Program provides a transparent peer-review process for open-source neuromorphic projects. Approved submissions receive the "ONM Community Approved" badge and are featured in our approved research registry.

### Why Submit?

-   **Gain Visibility:** Get your work recognized by the community
-   **Build Trust:** Earn the community-approved badge
-   **Get Expert Feedback:** Receive constructive review from volunteer experts
-   **Permanent Recognition:** Featured in our approved research registry with a certificate page

### Ready to Submit?

Visit our [Call for Papers page](/blog/announcing-the-onr-program/) to learn about submission requirements, the review process, and how to get started.

## Event Formats

You can contribute by speaking or leading a session in one of our established formats:

-   ### Workshops
    Lead a hands-on session or a deep-dive presentation on a specific neuromorphic tool, technology, or research area.

-   ### Student Talks
    Present your ongoing research, a recently published paper, or a comprehensive literature review. This is a great platform for students and early-career researchers to gain experience and feedback. For more details, see the [Student Talks initiative page](/neuromorphic-computing/initiatives/student-talks-initiative/).

-   ### Hacking Hours
    Join a live coding session as a guest to showcase a library, tackle a specific problem, or explore a new concept with the community.

## How to Propose Your Talk or Session

Getting started is easy. If you have a topic you're passionate about, we want to hear from you.

1.  **Have an Idea:** Think about what you'd like to share. It could be your latest project, a tutorial you've developed, or a concept you find exciting.

2.  **Reach Out to Us:** The best way to propose a session is on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hUygPUdD8E), but email is also a great option:
    -   **Discord:**
        -   For **Student Talks**, please post a message in the `#student-talks` channel.
        -   For all other events like **Workshops** or **Hacking Hours**, use the `#proposals-contributions` channel.
        -   Alternatively, you can send a direct message to an Executive Committee member (e.g., **Jens E. Pedersen**).
    -   **Email:** Send your proposal directly to [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org).

3.  **Tell Us About Your Idea:** In your message, please include:
    -   A brief title and description of your proposed talk/workshop.
    -   The type of event you're interested in (Workshop, Student Talk, etc.).
    -   A short bio of yourself.

## Our Support For You

Once your session is scheduled, we'll support you by:
-   Promoting the event across our website, social media, and Discord community.
-   Providing the streaming platform (e.g., YouTube Live).
