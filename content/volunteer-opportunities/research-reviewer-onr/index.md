## Role Overview
The Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) program is our community-driven peer-review initiative designed to validate and showcase high-impact, reproducible work in neuromorphic computing. As a Research Reviewer, you will play a crucial role in upholding the standards of open science and providing valuable feedback to authors. This is a high-impact opportunity to contribute your expertise, work alongside leaders in the field, and help elevate the quality of research in our community.

## Responsibilities
- Evaluate submissions (papers, code, datasets) against the official [ONR Review Criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria/), focusing on clarity, reproducibility, technical rigor, and community value.
- Provide constructive, signed, and actionable feedback to help authors improve their work.
- Adhere to the principles of transparency and integrity outlined in the [ONR Reviewer's Guide](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/reviewer-guide/).
- Complete reviews in a timely manner to ensure a smooth process for authors.

## Who We're Looking For
- Researchers, developers, and practitioners with expertise in any area of neuromorphic computing (e.g., hardware, SNN frameworks, computational neuroscience, event-based vision).
- Individuals with a strong commitment to the principles of open and reproducible science.
- Excellent analytical and written communication skills.
- Prior experience with academic or code peer-review is a plus, but not a requirement.

## How to Apply
To become a reviewer, please follow the steps outlined in our **[ONR Reviewer's Guide](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/reviewer-guide/)**. The primary step is to ensure your OpenReview profile is up-to-date.
