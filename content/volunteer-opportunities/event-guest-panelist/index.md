## Role Overview
To enrich our community events, we are building a network of knowledgeable individuals who are willing to participate as guest speakers, panelists, or discussion participants.

-   Be available for occasional invitations to speak or participate in panel discussions.
-   Share insights, opinions, and experiences on topics within your field of knowledge.
-   Engage in constructive dialogue with other panelists, hosts, and the audience.
-   Contribute to a lively and informative community conversation.

## Who We're Looking For
-   Researchers, developers, industry professionals, and students with expertise in any area of neuromorphic computing, from hardware and software to theory and applications.
-   Individuals who are passionate about sharing their knowledge and engaging in thoughtful discussion.
-   No formal presentation is required; this role is about contributing to a conversation.
