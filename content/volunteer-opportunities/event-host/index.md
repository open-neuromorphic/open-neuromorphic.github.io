-   Moderate the live chat and facilitate Q&A with the speaker.
-   Keep the event on schedule and manage time effectively.
-   Engage with the audience to create an interactive and inclusive environment.
-   Collaborate with the ONM team and speakers to plan the event flow.

## Who We're Looking For
-   Individuals who are confident and comfortable with public speaking (or wish to gain experience).
-   Someone with good communication and organizational skills.
-   A passion for neuromorphic computing and community building.
-   Familiarity with our event formats (Workshops, Student Talks, Hacking Hours) is a plus.
