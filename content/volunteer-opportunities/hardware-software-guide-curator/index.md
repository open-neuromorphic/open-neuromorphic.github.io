## Role Overview

Become an authoritative voice and a key shaper of knowledge in the neuromorphic ecosystem. The Open Neuromorphic **Hardware and Software Guides** are the cornerstone of our platform and our primary engine for community growth, serving as the first point of contact for thousands of researchers, students, and developers entering the field.

We are looking for knowledgeable and passionate experts to take on the vital role of curating these guides. As a curator, you will be directly responsible for maintaining the accuracy, depth, and relevance of our most valuable resources, ensuring ONM remains the most trusted and comprehensive hub for neuromorphic technology.

## Why This Role is Crucial

This is more than a maintenance task; it's a strategic position with a direct impact on the entire community. Your contributions will:

*   **Build Our Authority:** Your expertise will ensure our guides are the go-to resource, cementing ONM's reputation and significantly boosting our SEO and visibility.
*   **Drive Community Growth:** These guides are the main funnel bringing new members to our Discord and initiatives. Your work directly fuels our community's expansion.
*   **Shape the Field:** You will help build the future of our content. A key long-term goal is to develop a rich taxonomy for our guides (e.g., by application area, like "medical" or "aerospace"), which will enable us to create new, high-value content and resources for specialized audiences.

## Responsibilities

*   **Act as a Technical Reporter:** Stay informed about the latest developments in the field and identify new hardware, software, or significant project updates that should be included in our guides.
*   **Maintain Accuracy and Depth:** Regularly review and update existing entries with the latest specifications, research papers, version changes, and project statuses.
*   **Onboard New Technologies:** Create new, well-researched entries for emerging tools and platforms, following our established content archetypes.
*   **Engage with the Ecosystem:** Collaborate with project maintainers and the wider community to gather firsthand information and ensure our content is accurate and community-vetted.

## Who We're Looking For

This is a **domain expert and content curation role**, not a software development position. We are looking for individuals who are passionate about sharing knowledge and have:

*   **Deep Expertise:** A strong understanding of the current neuromorphic hardware and/or software landscape.
*   **A Passion for Technical Accuracy:** A detail-oriented mindset with a commitment to creating clear, precise, and reliable documentation.
*   **An Analytical Mindset:** An interest in not just listing tools, but helping to categorize and structure information to make it more useful for the community.
*   **Collaboration Skills:** Comfortable communicating with other experts and working within a community-driven project.
*   **Tools:** Comfortable with Markdown and the Git/GitHub workflow (submitting Pull Requests), or willing to learn with our support.
