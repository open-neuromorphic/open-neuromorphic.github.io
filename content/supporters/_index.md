## Becoming A Foundational Supporter: The Collaboration Network

We believe that by working together and promoting each other's work, we can elevate the entire field. Our open-source partners help us by linking back to Open Neuromorphic from their project websites, GitHub repositories, or documentation.

This simple act of cross-promotion helps build domain authority and brings more visibility to everyone in the network, creating a virtuous cycle of discovery and growth. In return, we are proud to feature them here and across our platform.

You can support our community by linking back to us. Here are examples you can use in your project website, `README.md`, and generated documentation sites.

### Text Link

A simple text link is a great way to show support. We recommend linking to our main "Neuromorphic Computing" hub.

## Become a Supporter

If your project, lab, or company is interested in joining our mission, we would love to hear from you. We offer various levels of partnership, including direct sponsorship of open-source development.

### Sponsoring Open-Source Development

Supporting the open-source tools that power neuromorphic research is one of the most impactful ways to accelerate the entire field. When you click the "Sponsor" button on our [Mission Board](/getting-involved/solving-neuromorphic-computings-key-challenges/), you are showing interest in funding a solution. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

**1. Sponsor Projects Directly**

Many of the projects in our network accept direct financial support. This is a great way to help the tools you rely on the most. We encourage you to visit their GitHub repositories and look for "Sponsor" buttons or other information on how to contribute financially.

**2. Sponsor Open Neuromorphic to Coordinate a Solution**

If you want to fund a solution to a specific problem, you can sponsor Open Neuromorphic to manage the process. By sponsoring ONM, you fund the organizational effort required to solve key challenges. We will:
- Work with the community and project maintainers to scope out the problem.
- Define a clear solution and map out the required work.
- Manage a bounty to incentivize and reward developers for implementing the solution.

This ensures that contributions are effective, well-coordinated, and aligned with the ecosystem's needs.

Unsure which path is right for you, or want to discuss a broader partnership? Please reach out to us at [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org), and we can help guide you.
