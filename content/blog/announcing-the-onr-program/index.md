## Announcing the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program

Open Neuromorphic is excited to launch the **Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program**, a new community-driven initiative designed to promote and validate open and reproducible research in the neuromorphic field.

### Why a Community Peer Review Program?

In our rapidly evolving field, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration are more important than ever. The ONR program aims to address this by establishing a trusted, community-led peer-review process. Our goal is to create a curated registry of high-quality research that exemplifies the best practices of open science.

By participating, you can:
-   **Gain Visibility:** Get your work recognized and highlighted by the community.
-   **Build Trust:** Earn the "ONM Community Approved" badge for your project.
-   **Accelerate Science:** Contribute to a shared ecosystem of reliable and reusable research.

### How It Works

The ONR program is built on a transparent review process managed through OpenReview. We welcome submissions of all kinds, from research papers and codebases to datasets and educational tools.

1.  **Submit Your Work:** Use our straightforward submission process to share your project with the community.
2.  **Community Review:** Your submission will be evaluated by a panel of volunteer reviewers based on our [official review criteria](/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria/), focusing on clarity, reproducibility, and impact.
3.  **Get Recognized:** Approved projects are added to our [Approved Research Registry](/neuromorphic-computing/research/papers/) and receive the official ONR badge.

### Get Involved!

Whether you're a researcher with a project to share or an expert willing to lend your time as a reviewer, there's a place for you in the ONR program.
