## Announcing the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program

Open Neuromorphic is excited to launch the **Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) Program**, a new community-driven initiative designed to promote open and reproducible research in Neuromorphic Computing.

To explore the full program, including how to submit your work, the review process, and our registry of approved research, visit the official **[ONR Hub]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research" >}})**.

### Why a Community Peer Review Program?

In our rapidly evolving field, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration are more important than ever. The ONR program aims to address this by establishing a trusted, community-led peer-review process. Our goal is to create a curated registry of high-quality research that exemplifies the best practices of open science.

By participating, you can:
-   **Gain Visibility:** Get your work recognized and highlighted by the community.
-   **Build Trust:** Earn the "ONM Community Approved" badge for your project.
-   **Accelerate Science:** Contribute to a shared ecosystem of reliable and reusable research.

### How It Works

The ONR program is built on a transparent review process managed through OpenReview. We welcome submissions of all kinds, from research papers and codebases to datasets and educational tools.

1.  **Submit Your Work:** Follow our [**Submitter's Guide**]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/submitter-guide" >}}) to share your project through our guided process on OpenReview.
2.  **Community Review:** Your submission will be evaluated by a panel of volunteer reviewers based on our [official review criteria]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria" >}}), focusing on clarity, reproducibility, and impact.
3.  **Get Recognized:** Approved projects are awarded the "ONM Community Approved" badge and showcased with a dedicated **certificate page** in our [Approved Research Registry]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/papers" >}}).

### Get Involved!

Whether you're a researcher with a project to share or an expert willing to lend your time as a reviewer, there's a place for you in the ONR program.
