## Call for Papers: Open Neuromorphic Research

Open Neuromorphic is launching [**Open Neuromorphic Research**]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/" >}}) a peer review initiative designed to highlight open, reproducible, and high-impact work in neuromorphic computing. Submissions are reviewed by volunteers from the community and, if approved, receive the **ONM Community Approved** badge along with a certificate page in our [Approved Research Registry]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/papers" >}}).

Whether you’re submitting a research paper, codebase, dataset, or educational tool, ONR gives you a pathway to visibility, constructive feedback, and community validation.


### Why Participate?

- **Get Recognized**: Approved projects receive a badge and are showcased in our registry  
- **Get Reviewed**: Receive constructive feedback from expert volunteers  
- **Build Trust**: Show your commitment to open, transparent science  
- **Accelerate the Field**: Help build a shared ecosystem of reproducible tools

### What Can You Submit?

We accept open-source neuromorphic projects including:

- Research codebases (e.g. SNN models, simulators)
- Publication-style papers
- Datasets and preprocessing pipelines
- Educational resources, tutorials, and docs
- Hardware libraries (e.g. for Loihi, Speck, etc.)
- Analysis or visualization tools

Submissions may be GitHub repositories, Jupyter notebooks, whitepapers, or IEEE-formatted papers. All submissions must meet our [Definition of Open]({{< ref "/about/governance/open-definition" >}}).

## How It Works

1. **Prepare Your Submission**: Follow the [Submitter's Guide]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/submitter-guide" >}})
2. **Submit via OpenReview**: Use the [ONR Submission Portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=ONR)
3. **Community Review**: Your submission is reviewed by 3–5 volunteers, based on criteria like clarity, reproducibility, and contribution
4. **Receive Recognition**: Approved projects are awarded a badge and added to our public registry

### Review Criteria

Reviews focus on:

- **Relevance** to neuromorphic computing  
- **Clarity** and documentation  
- **Reproducibility** of code/methods  
- **Technical rigor**  
- **Openness** (permissive license, transparent methods)  
- **Community value** (benefit to students, researchers, etc.)

Details available in the [Review Criteria]({{< ref "/neuromorphic-computing/research/guide/review-criteria" >}}).

### Timeline

- **Submissions**: Accepted on a rolling basis  
- **Review turnaround**: Typically within 1 month (depending on submission size)
- **Decisions**: Constructive feedback provided for all submissions.  Submissions are either accepted or revisions are requested.
