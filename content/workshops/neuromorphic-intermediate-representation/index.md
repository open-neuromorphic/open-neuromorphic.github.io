Have you wondered how to use neuromorphic hardware platforms?

Are you depressed by your power bill after you bought your >400W GPU rig?

Then you came to the right place!

In this workshop, we will show you how to move models from your favourite framework directly to neuromorphic hardware with 1-2 lines of code!
We will present the technology behind, the [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation](/workshops/neuromorphic-intermediate-representation/), and demonstrate how we can use it to run a live spiking convnet on the [Speck](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/speck-synsense/) chip.

NIR is currently supported by [Intel Loihi](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/loihi-intel/), [Speck](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/speck-synsense/), [SpiNNaker2](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/spinnaker-2-university-of-dresden/), [Xylo](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/xylo-synsense/) and a host of simulators, including [Norse](/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/norse/), [snnTorch](/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/snntorch/), and [Spyx](/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/spyx/).

Join us on the 5th of February to get your own hands-on experience with NIR and neuromorphic hardware!

All it requires is a computer and a bit of Python knowledge.

**Agenda:**
- 18:00 - 19:00: NIR introduction
  - Motivation: coupling neuromorphic hardware and software
  - Demonstrating NIR: from PyTorch to Speck
  - Q&A 
- 19:00 - 20:00: Workshop
  - Hands-on experience with NIR via Jupyter Notebooks or custom models
  - Q&A and collaborative discussions
