description: "This offers a sneak-peek into Innatera’s technology stack allowing application development from scratch and deploying it on mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware."
speaker_bio: "George is currently **Product Architect** at **Innatera**. He completed his Ph.D. from the **Dynamical systems and risk lab**, **University College Dublin**, focusing on continuous-time non- von Neumann computing paradigms. Prior to that, as an engineering physics graduate, he worked on classical approximations of quantum effects in photonics. At Innatera, he helps define the software and hardware architecture for Innatera’s product vision. His other interests span across compilers, music theory, and long-distance cycling. He believes that the best bet for embedded AI in real applications is through neuromorphic computing. His day-to-day revolves around finding balance - where do real signals stop and spikes begin, where do developers stop and compilers begin, where does work stop and life begin? "
