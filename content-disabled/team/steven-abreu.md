title: "Steven Abreu"
description: "Steve is doing his PhD on neuromorphic computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group at the new [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/about/) center for cognitive systems and materials in Groningen. He is funded by the European [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network.


In his PhD, he works with different neuromorphic systems ([Loihi 2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html), [DynapSE2](https://www.synsense.ai/products/dynap-se2/), and [photonic reservoirs](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/research/topics.asp?ID=112)) to develop programming methods for devices that explore a richer set of physical dynamics than the synchronous bi-stable switching that (most of) computer science relies on. Steve's background is in computer science and machine learning, with a touch of physics."
